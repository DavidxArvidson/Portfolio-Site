        <!--About Me-->
        <h3>About David</h3>
        <p>I got my first taste for coding in middle school computer class working with some very basic HTML. I continued to play around with the concept of coding over the years on and off while I pursued other avenues. After graduating from college and exploring various career options, software development popped up as a recommendation from trusted friends who knew how my brain worked. I thought back to middle school computer class and decided to give it a try and I haven't looked back since!</p>
        <p>As I already mentioned above, I have a wide variety of interests and am curious about a multitude of things. I grew up abroad and studied international affairs and politics while in college. I am also a professional actor and model with training in theatre, musical theatre, film, tv, and voice-over performance in addition to print, life-style, and high-fashion modeling.</p>
        <p>As someone who is used to working in a cast, I love working with others! If you're looking to add a developer to your team or are interested in collaborating on a project, reach out using the contact section below. I can't wait to hear from you!</p>
